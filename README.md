# GENERIC E-COMMERCE

It's generic e-commerce, in other words, it doesn't have a specific niche.
Any type of product can be registered. It's need that some configurations
are made like aws and mysql database configuration but this project's just for display (portfolio).
The features are made available through a REST API. REST ( Representational State Transfer) is a web-inspired architecture style. 

This' an e-commerce project built up with the following technologies:

- Java
- Spring Framework
- AWS-SDK
- MySql Database
- Maven
- And other stuff...
